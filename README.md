# Week 6
### Bank Institution Term Deposit Predictive Model
> The Bank of Portugal, therefore, collected a huge amount of data that includes customers profiles of those who have to subscribe to term deposits and the ones who did not subscribe to a term deposit. As their newly employed machine learning researcher, they want you to come up with a robust predictive model that would help them identify customers who would or would not subscribe to their term deposit in the future.
>Your main goal as a machine learning researcher is to carry out data exploration, data cleaning, feature extraction, and developing robust machine learning algorithms that would aid them in the department.

### Content
The repo contains the following:
- README - explaining the project, and a guide on how to run the code
- Requirement.txt - which python packages are needed to run your code
- Main.py - imports all the necessary classes and functions from other files and automates the process of pre-processing, model training, and  model prediction.
- Data.py - contains all functions and classes you write to do the pre-processing 
- Model.py - contains all functions and classes you write to generate your model
- notebooks/ - a folder that contains jupyter notebooks you use to develop your code (Contains Data Visualizations too)
